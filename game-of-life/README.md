# Conway's Game of Life

The game starts with an initial configuration of live and dead cells. The rules are then applied repeatedly to each cell in the grid, creating a sequence of generations.  

Key Features:

- Emergence: Despite the simple rules, complex patterns and structures can emerge from the initial configuration.   

- Self-replication: Some patterns can create copies of themselves, demonstrating a form of self-replication.  
- Turing Completeness: The Game of Life has been proven to be Turing complete, meaning it can simulate any computer algorithm.
